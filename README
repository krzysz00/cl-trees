===cl-trees===

This is a library for trees of various types in Common Lisp.
Initially, only binary trees (plain and search) will be supported, but
more tree types will be added eventually. The library will be (gasp!),
well documented, and have a generic function interface.

The operations supported by this library will be:
 * Lookup
 * Insert
 * Delete
 * Rebalance (if applicable)
 * Convert between tree types
 * And much more ... 

The projhect is hosted at GitHub ( https://github.com/krzysz00/cl-trees )
The issue tracking, documentation, etc. are located there.
