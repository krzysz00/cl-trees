===cl-trees===

This is a library for trees of various types in Common Lisp. The
amount of implemented tree types will be low initially, but expansion
is planned. The library will be (gasp!), well documented, and have a
generic function interface.

The operations supported by this library will be:
 * Lookup
 * Insert
 * Delete
 * Rebalance (if applicable)
 * Convert between tree types
 * Serialize a tree to a list
 * And much more ... 

The project is hosted at GitHub ( https://github.com/krzysz00/cl-trees )
The issue tracking, documentation, etc. are located there.
